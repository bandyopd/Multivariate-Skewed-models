R and JAGS code for implementing the Semiparametric Multivariate Skew (SMS) model and the Parametric Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to simulated data


There are 2 folders in the repository: SMS and PGM. The contents of the folders are below:


1) Simulated_Data.csv : .csv files containing the simulated dataset. 

2) SMS_run.R and PGM_run.R:  A set of R commands for implementing the Bayesian analysis of the SMS and PGM models in JAGS, respectively

3) SMS.txt and PGM.txt:      Text files with the BUGS code for the SMS and PGM models, respectively.
